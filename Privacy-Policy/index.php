        You can request from WOOBLE to restrict your personal data from further
        processing in any of the following events:
    </p>
    <p>
        you state the personal data about you is incorrect, subject to the time
        WOOBLE requires to check the accuracy of the relevant personal data,
    </p>
    <p>
        there is no legal basis for WOOBLE to process your personal data and you
        demand WOOBLE to restrict your personal data from further processing,
    </p>
    <p>
        WOOBLE no longer requires your personal data, but you state you require
        WOOBLE to retain such data to claim or exercise legal rights or to
        defend against third party claims, or
    </p>
    <p>
        in case you object to the processing of your personal data by WOOBLE
        based on WOOBLE’s legitimate interest (as further set out below),
        subject to the time required for WOOBLE to determine whether it has a
        prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your personal
        data.

    <h4>Right to object</h4>
    <p>
        If and to the extent WOOBLE is processing your personal data based on
        WOOBLE's Legitimate Interest, specifically where WOOBLE pursues its
        legitimate interest to engage in direct marketing or to apply profiling
        in relation to direct marketing, you have the right to object to such a
        use of your personal data at any time. When you object to WOOBLE's
        processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, WOOBLE
        will immediately cease to process your personal data for such purposes.
        In all other cases, WOOBLE will carefully review your objection and
        cease further use of the relevant information, subject to WOOBLE’s
        compelling legitimate grounds for continued use of the information,
        which may override your interest in objecting, or if WOOBLE requires the
        information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
    </p>
    <h4>Right to revoke consent</h4>
    <p>
        Wherever WOOBLE is processing your personal data based on your consent,
        you may at any time withdraw your consent by unsubscribing or giving us
        respective notice of withdrawal (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e2e6a6f7a6f7e7c617a6b6d7a676160616868676d6b7c4e7961616c626b20617c69"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8febeefbeefffde0fbeaecfbe6e0e1e0e9e9e6eceafdcff8e0e0ede3eaa1e0fde8">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>). In
        case of withdrawal, WOOBLE will not process personal data subject to
        this consent any longer unless legally required to do so. In case WOOBLE
        is required to retain your personal data for legal reasons your personal
        data will be restricted from further processing and only retained for
        the term required by law. However, any withdrawal has no effect on past
        processing of personal data by WOOBLE up to the point in time of your
        withdrawal. Furthermore, if your use of an WOOBLE offering requires your
        prior consent, WOOBLE will no longer be able to provide the relevant
        service (or services, if you revoke the consent for WOOBLE to use your
        profile under the WOOBLE Identity Authentication Service for multiple

        applicable data protection laws, you can at any time, to the extent
        required by applicable law, lodge a complaint with your locally relevant

        protection right you want to exercise. When feasible, WOOBLE will match
        personal data provided by you in submitting a request to exercise your
        rights with information already maintained by WOOBLE. This could include
        matching two or more data points you provide when you submit a request
        with two or more data points that are already maintained by WOOBLE.
    </p>
    <p>
        WOOBLE will decline to process requests that are manifestly unfounded,
        excessive, fraudulent, represented by third parties without duly
        representing respective authority or are otherwise not required by local
        law.
